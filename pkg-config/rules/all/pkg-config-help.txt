** Help for users of RULES=pkg-config **

These rules provide support for generation of interface files for
packages configured with pkg-config.

The following variable must be set:

 * PKG_CONFIG_PACKAGE -- the name of the package for pkg-config

The following optional variables may be set:

 * PKG_CONFIG_PC_DIR -- the name of the directory in which to
   find the .pc files.  This can be set for testing and to access
   .pc files are not installed in standard locations known by
   pkg-config.

 * PKG_CONFIG_INTERFACE -- the name of the after-build interface
   file to create.  The default is pkg-config.interface.  It may
   be useful to override this if you wish to do postprocessing
   on the file

By default, a file called pkg-config.interface is generated by
users of the contrib-pkg-config build item.  Usually, you just
have to include

  after-build $(ABUILD_OUTPUT_DIR)/pkg-config.interface

in your Abuild.interface file to make the results visible to
your users.
